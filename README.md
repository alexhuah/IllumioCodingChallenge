# IllumioCodingChallenge

1. Visual Studio Solution is provided with all files needed to open and run program
2. Notes
    * The input files are given as command line arguments in the format of: <NAT.txt> <FLOW.txt>
    * The type of input files are consisting of text files currently due to limited time
    * The program mostly runs but fails to identify a single pair for *:21 and 9.8.7.6:21
    * Program is able to compile and run perfectly fine. No errors should arise.
3. My Implementation Notes
    * I currently tested the solution manually given a NAT.txt and FLOW.txt file through command-line arguments.
    * I chose to use a map due to it's efficiency in insertion and searching
    * Overloaded less than operator to fit my custom key class
    * I would've refined the implementation by using regex to do string manipulation and by actually fixing the bug for the pair so that it outputs properly
    * It would've been more defined because regex is much more efficient when doing string manipulation and fixing the bug would make the program run correctly. 
    * Please refer to notes and thank you for taking your time to review my coding challenge! I hope you have a nice day and hopefully we will be in contact!
